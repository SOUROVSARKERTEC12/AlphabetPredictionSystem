Alphabet (Character) Recognition System
Input: Draw character in air
Output: Recognition of that character

I am reshaping my data into 28*28 pixel. To train my model, I am passing 80% of my data to training part and 20% of my data to testing part. 
Remember, training data are used to train our model and testing data are used to calculate accuracy.
I am using Keras to fit my model, which is very popular deep learning framework. 

The main focus :

python-mnist = 0.7 
tensorflow = 2.10.0
opencv-python = 4.6.0.66
numpy = 1.21.6
scikit-learn = 1.0.2
